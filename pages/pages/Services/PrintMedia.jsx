          The time is long overdue for a massive flooding of the earth with the
          Book of Mormon for the many reasons which the Lord has given. In this
          age of electronic media and mass distribution of the printed word, God
          will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a
          monumental way I don't think there will ever be a permanent truce, but
          I believe the media needs to be more careful and be willing to count
          to 10 before rushing on the air or into print People are just really
          overreacting. It's just feel good music. We at Virgin are in no way
          promoting or whatever these media outlets continue to print In the
          past, I've been reluctant to share any bits of truth about myself or
          to really let people in on my reality. So I have said some things to
          throw people off the scent of what's really going on in my life. So I
          have sort of aided the media in printing these misconceptions, which I
          regret I heard some famous people had an anniversary, five long years
          together, it was Hollywood history. Now my grandma and grandpa never
          made no printed page, but they took the love of 57 years right to the
          grave.
